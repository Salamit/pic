My answers to Programming in C (3rd Edition) by Stephen G. Kochan as part of the required reading for the Harvard cs50 course.

Having been unable to find answers to the exercises, I have mine here in the hopes that it can be of assistance to others. Feel free to message me if the code could be better.  

You will find the book examples and exercises here. In each folder chapter is a folder for the book examples and a separate folder for the book exercises. 

Long live bytes! :p
