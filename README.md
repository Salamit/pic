My answers to Programming in C (3rd Edition) by Stephen G. Kochan.

Having searched for recent answers to the exercises I have put this on the web in the hopes that it can be of assistance to others. Feel free to message me if the code could be better.  

I completing this book as part of the required reading for the Harvard cs50 course.

Long live bytes!
