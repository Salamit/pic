      <p>I am completing this book as part of the required reading for the <a href="goo.gl/Ewn73P">Harvard CS50x course</a>.</p>

<p>Having searched for answers to the exercises and found very little help, I have put my answers on my github page for anyone who needs them. </p>

<p>You will find the book examples as well. </p>

<p><strong>You will find the documents organised by chapter. Every chapter has a folder for the book examples and a separate folder for my answers to the exercises.</strong> </p>

<p>Feel free to message me if the code could be better.  </p>

<p>Long live bytes!</p>
